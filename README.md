# Human Image Segmentation

Overview:
This project focuses on using advanced computer vision to precisely identify and outline human subjects in images. It employs a powerful deep learning model called U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder and is trained on a diverse dataset capturing different scenarios. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of human image segmentation for applications like augmented reality and object recognition.

Description:
The project uses a special kind of computer program (U-Net with ResNet34) to accurately find and highlight people in pictures. We trained this program using a variety of images with different poses and backgrounds. By fine-tuning the program and testing it extensively, we aim to make it really good at recognizing humans in all sorts of situations. The project also looks into making it user-friendly for practical uses like augmented reality experiences and better understanding images.
